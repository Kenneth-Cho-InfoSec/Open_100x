Open 100x is an Android camera app built to give more phones access to extreme 100x zoom-style shooting, even when the stock camera app does not expose that kind of range.

The goal is not just to add a bigger zoom slider. Open 100x is meant to be an open extreme-zoom tool with local image enhancement, pro-style controls, stability feedback, and traditional image processing designed specifically for the messy reality of long-range mobile zoom.

## What It Does

- Unlocks up to 100x zoom through native camera zoom plus digital crop.
- Adds controls and feedback designed for high zoom, including stability status, histogram tools, grid modes, zoom presets, flashlight support, and crop nudging.
- Includes local post-processing for extreme zoom captures.
- Uses traditional, non-AI image processing only.
- Runs fully on-device with no cloud processing and no external APIs.

## Local Upscaling And Denoising

Open 100x includes a local post-processing path for zoomed images. The purpose is to push open, traditional image-processing techniques that can make extreme phone zoom more usable.

The enhancement pipeline may include:

- Denoising
- Smoothing
- Sharpening
- Contrast and detail recovery
- Local upscaling suitable for high-zoom crops

These algorithms are implemented locally in the app and are designed to improve noisy, soft, high-magnification phone images without AI/ML inference.

## Beta Release

The current beta APK is available from the GitHub release page:
